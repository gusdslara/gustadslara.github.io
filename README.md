## 🤖 SEO & AI Indexation Optimization

This portfolio is heavily optimized for modern search engines and AI parsers. The following optimizations have been deployed:

- **Advanced Metadata**: Includes comprehensive **Open Graph (OG)** and **Twitter Card** tags ensuring rich, visual previews when shared on social media and communication platforms.
- **GEO Targeted Tags**: Configured with `geo.region`, `geo.placename`, `geo.position`, and `ICBM` metatags focused on Brazil, explicitly boosting local/regional search ranking.
- **Rich JSON-LD Schema (AI Indexation)**: Injects an `application/ld+json` schema defining a `Person` and a `WebSite` within the `<svelte:head>`. This semantic structure explicitly provides context to AI crawlers (e.g., Google's AI Overview, ChatGPT Search) regarding the author, expertise (Software Architecture, Microservices, SvelteKit, etc.), external profiles (GitHub/LinkedIn), and general portfolio details.
